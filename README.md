<h2>Installation</h2>
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Then, simply download the md5checktool.py file and run it with Python.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you have saved md5checktool.py.
Run the script by entering: python md5checktool.py <path_to_file> <md5_checksum>, where <path_to_file> is the path to the file you want to check, and <md5_checksum> is the MD5 hash you want to compare with.
  
For example:
python md5checktool.py example.txt 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

This will check if the MD5 hash of example.txt matches 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592.
